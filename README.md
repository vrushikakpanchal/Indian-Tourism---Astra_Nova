🌟 What Indian Tourism Explorer Does
Our app offers four core features that make planning your Indian trip seamless:

1. Statewise Explorer
Pick any state in India and get a detailed list of tourist attractions — including cities, place types, Google review ratings, and their historical or cultural significance.

2. Month-wise Festival Map
Want to visit India during festival season? Select a month, and the app highlights states known for major festivals in that time, along with their top tourist spots. For example, October highlights Gujarat’s Navratri and West Bengal’s Durga Puja.

3. AI-Powered Travel Planner
Tell our chatbot your travel preferences — like “I have 5 days in July and want to visit Pune” — and get a custom 3-5 day itinerary covering the best places to visit, optimal timings, and more.

4. Tourist Analytics Dashboard
Dive into travel trends with interactive charts showing the most visited states, average ratings, and popular months for tourism, helping you choose your next destination wisely.
